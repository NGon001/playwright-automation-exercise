Slightly modified Test Case 9 to strengthen the verification of the product search feature.
- For each keyword [e.g., "dress", "top", "tshirt"], the test performs a product search.
- It first checks whether the product names in the search results contain the keyword.
- If a product's name doesn't match, its link is collected for further validation.
- The test then opens product detail pages to verify that the product's category includes the keyword.
- If neither the name nor category matches, the test fails.
